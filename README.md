# Brain-Hackathon 2026 – Autonomipartiet Project

## Overview

**Brain-Hackathon 2026** challenges participants to explore the intersection of politics, technology, and AI in education by creating a **virtual political party**—the **Autonomipartiet**—represented entirely by avatars. Teams design a forward-looking party program, participate in a simulated election, and produce creative, AI-driven solutions for society of the future.

The goal is to combine **visionary policy thinking**, **AI integration**, and **technical innovation** to imagine how society, education, and work could evolve.
